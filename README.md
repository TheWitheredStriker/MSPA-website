So I figured I could just as well practice my front-end webdev skill and whatnot by making my own website about something I think is cool, rather than making boring and flawed college assignments. Uh, stick around if you will, I suppose. But don't fucking bitch at me for poor code quality or use of hacks where I saw no other way. Oh, and the fucked up indentation? Yeah, blame GitHub for that. Not my problem.
