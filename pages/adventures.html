			<h2>Jailbreak</h2>
			<section>
				<img src="../images/adventure-jailbreak.png" alt="Jailbreak">
				<div class="textContainer">
					<p>2006&ndash;2011 | Complete | Digital | Vague setting | 135 pages</p>
					<p>The very first "proper" MS Paint Adventure, originally started in 2006. It went on hiatus in 2007, but was eventually finished in 2011, during a lengthy <em>Homestuck</em> hiatus. The core idea behind <em>Jailbreak</em> is that whenever Andrew Hussie finished drawing a page, he would post to the Gangbunch Forums and incorporate the suggestion of the first person to reply as the next panel unconditionally, no matter how unfunny or nonsensical. This led to a haphazard and absurd plot &ndash; perhaps a logical outcome for what was essentially a forum game.</p>

					<p>Jailbreak focuses on three unnamed prisoners as they attempt to escape from a prison. Being little more than a shitpost in its beginnings, no context is ever given for who the prisoners are or why they have been jailed, and they essentially have no personality whatsoever. Following a reset that occured after all the prisoners died, one of them finally made it out alive, but became entangled in a bizarre situation involving elves, magic and a sentient pony. This prisoner later became the MSPA Reader seen in <em>Problem Sleuth</em> and the <em>Homestuck</em> franchise through unknown means.</p>

			<h2>Bard Quest</h2>
			<section>
				<img src="../images/adventure-bardQuest.png" alt="Bard Quest">
				<div class="textContainer">
					<p>2007 | Unfinished | Digital | Fantasy | 47 pages</p>
					<p>The second MS Paint Adventure, created by Andrew Hussie in the summer of 2007. The main catch of this story was that Andrew intended for it to be a "Choose your own adventure" game in full, with multiple choices and branching paths leading to different endings. By comparison, <em>Jailbreak</em> features two linear split paths which recombined, <em>Problem Sleuth</em> occasionally features one-or-two-panel alternate options which would typically get a protagonist killed, and <em>Homestuck</em> stays linear until late in Act 5 and throughout Act 6, where occasionally multiple paths present themselves, and loop back so they can all be read before proceeding linearly again.</p>

					<p>The story of <em>Bard Quest</em> focused on an unnamed Bard, as he is brought before a bored king to amuse him with song and dance. His antics led to him being dispatched to slay an evil dragon instead. This story was based on the 221st Scribblette from Hussie's other webcomic franchise, <em>Team Special Olympics</em>. Unfortunately, <em>Bard Quest</em> was never finished &ndash; the large amount of branching paths proved untenable for Hussie, and after getting overwhelmed, he decided to call it quits.</p>

			<h2>Problem Sleuth</h2>
			<section>
				<img src="../images/adventure-problemSleuth.png" alt="Problem Sleuth">
				<div class="textContainer">
					<p>2008&ndash;2009 | Complete | Digital &bull; Physical | Noir &bull; Science fantasy | 1674 pages</p>
					<p>The third MS Paint Adventure, and the first one to reach mainstream success. <em>Problem Sleuth</em> was the first adventure to introduce animated GIF's, as well as colour, into the MSPA formula, shying away from merely using black-and-white drawings. <em>Problem Sleuth</em> continues to maintain an active and respectable following to the present day, and was the first adventure to be printed for a physical release.</p>

					<p>The story of <em>Problem Sleuth</em> focuses on the eponymous detective of the same name, who, along with his rivals Ace Dick and Pickle Inspector, operates out of the same building. When all three become trapped inside their respective offices, they join forces to find a way out of their predicament and defeat the evil Mobster Kingpin, who possesses the key they need to leave their building. In order to accomplish this, the trio must travel into the Imaginary World, another dimension where they can bring their wildest thoughts to life. From hereon out, the story becomes a pastiche of video games, science fiction, and surreal humor.</p>

			<h2>Homestuck</h2>
			<section>
				<img src="../images/adventure-homestuck.png" alt="Homestuck">
				<div class="textContainer">
					<p>2009&ndash;2016 | Complete | Digital &bull; Physical | Urban fantasy &bull; Science fantasy | 8134 pages</p>
					<p>The fourth MS Paint Adventure, and by far and large the most popular one of them all, having spawned its own media franchise. <em>Homestuck</em> takes several elements introduced in <em>Problem Sleuth</em>, like the video game mechanics, metafictional themes, and use of animation, and dials all of them up to eleven, further adding Flash animated videos, interactive minigames and chatlogs to its storytelling.</p>

					<p>The story of <em>Homestuck</em> revolves around a group of teens who unwittingly cause the apocalypse by playing a reality-warping video game known as SBURB, which grants them supernatural abilities. In order to save the world, the Beta Kids, as they are called, need to work together with an alien species called Trolls, as well as alternate timeline equivalents of themselves, to complete SBURB and create a new universe. But behind the scenes, a group of villains works to unleash Lord English onto the world &ndash; a time-traveling demon who will destroy reality.</p>

			<h2>Homestuck²: Beyond Canon</h2>
			<section>
				<img src="../images/adventure-homestuckSquared.png" alt="Homestuck²: Beyond Canon">
				<div class="textContainer">
					<p>2019&ndash;present | Ongoing | Digital | Science fantasy &bull; Melodrama &bull; Metafiction | 407 (541 with bonus pages)</p>
					<p>A non-canon sequel to <em>Homestuck</em>. The story initially started with a prose-based introduction (without images) known as <em>The Homestuck Epilogues</em>, which served to set up the story of <em>Homestuck²</em> (although it is often referred to as "Homestuck 2" and pronounced as such, the proper title is pronounced as "Homestuck Squared"). The entire story is mentioned by Andrew Hussie to be "of dubious authenticity", being canon to <em>Homestuck</em> itself only if the reader believes it is.</p>

					<p><em>Homestuck²</em> takes place across two different timelines: "Meat" (set 10 years after the events of <em>Homestuck</em>) and "Candy" (set 23 years after the events of <em>Homestuck</em>). "Candy" revoles around the lives of the original comic's characters in Earth C as they undergo a large amount of melodrama and personal struggles, most notably the corruption of Jane Crocker after her election to Earth C's presidency, starting a reign of terror. "Meat" revolves around a different betrayal: Dirk Strider ascends to his Ultimate Self and takes over <em>Homestuck</em>'s narrative, becoming a megalomaniac and power-hungry antagonist in the process, forcing his former friends to set out and stop him.</p>
